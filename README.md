# -University-Rankings

Project Summary
This project explores global university rankings, focusing on how research performance shapes rankings. Using CWUR (Center for World University Rankings) data from 2012-2016, the goal is to identify key factors influencing rankings and understand the role of research output in university performance.

Key Questions
What factors have the strongest impact on university rankings?
How does research output (publications, influence, broad impact) correlate with ranking?
Do universities with higher research performance consistently rank higher?
How can universities improve their rankings by enhancing research?
What distinguishes top, mid-tier, and developing universities in terms of research output?

Project Structure
The analysis is structured into six key components:

Exploratory Analysis â€“ Understanding dataset trends.

Exploring Relationships â€“ Identifying correlations between factors.

Geographical Analysis â€“ Mapping university rankings globally.

Machine Learning: Regression â€“ Predicting rankings based on research impact.

Machine Learning: Clustering â€“ Categorizing universities by performance tiers.

Time Series Analysis â€“ Analyzing ranking trends over time.

Data & Tools
Dataset: Covers world university rankings from 2012-2016, sourced from Kaggle.

Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (Python).

Visualization: Tableau Public.
